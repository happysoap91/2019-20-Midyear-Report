abstract = {Multiple regression analysis (MRA), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) were applied to two case studies to contrast the application results. Case 1 is the fracture prediction based on studies of 34 samples from Wells An1 and An2 in the Anpeng Oilfield of the Biyang Sag, Nanxiang Basin. Case 2 is the gassiness evaluation of 40 samples in tight sandstones in the Tabamiao area, Ordos Basin. The results are as follows: (1) The nonlinear methods, SVM and ANN, are far superior to the linear method, MRA; (2) SVM presents absolute superiority due to zero error and fast speed, indicating that it is the best machine-learning method till date; (3) ANN is almost as accurate as SVM in Case 1, but ANN is less precise than SVM in Case 2; (4) MRA is fast and can establish the order of dependence between the study target and its related multi-geological-factors that cannot be estimated using SVM and ANN. Therefore, SVM is recommended when describing any complex relationship between a target and its related geological factors and MRA can be used as an auxiliary tool. ?? 2008 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration {\&} Development, PetroChina.},

@article{Kim2014,
abstract = {Abstract We investigate fracture propagation induced by hydraulic fracturing with water-injection, using numerical simulation. For full 3D rigorous modeling, we employ a numerical method that can model failure due to tensile and shear stresses, dynamic nonlinear permeability, the dual continuum approach, leak-off in all directions, and thermo-poro-mechanical effects. From the numerical results, fracture propagation is not the same as propagation of the water front, because fracturing is governed by geomechanics, whereas water saturation is determined by fluid flow. At early times, the water saturation front is almost identical to the fracture tip, showing that the fracture is mostly filled with injected water. However, at late times, advance of the water front is retarded, compared to the fracture propagation, yielding a significant gap between the water front and the fracture top, which is filled with reservoir gas. We also find considerable leak-off of water to the reservoir. The inconsistency between the fracture volume and the volume of injected water cannot properly estimate the fracture length, when it is estimated based on the simple assumption that the fracture is fully saturated with injected water. As an example of flow-geomechanical responses, we identify pressure fluctuation under constant water injection, because hydraulic fracturing is itself a set of many failure processes, in which pressure drops every time when failure occurs. The fluctuation decreases as the fracture length grows. We also study application of electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods, because the EM geophysical methods are highly sensitive to changes in porosity and pore-fluid properties, such as water injection into gas reservoirs. We employ a 3D finite-element EM geophysical simulator and evaluate the sensitivity of the crosswell EM method for monitoring fluid movements in shaly reservoirs. For the sensitivity evaluation, reservoir models are generated through the coupled flow-geomechanical simulator and are transformed via a rock physics model into electrical conductivity models. It is shown that anomalous conductivity distribution in the resulting models is closely related with injected water saturation but little with newly-created unsaturated fractures. The numerical modeling experiments demonstrate that the crosswell EM method can be highly sensitive to conductivity changes that directly indicate the migration pathways of the injected fluid. Accordingly, the EM method can serve as an effective monitoring tool for distribution of injected water (i.e. migration pathways) during hydraulic fracturing operations.},

@article{HymanJimenez2016,
abstract = {Despite the impact that hydraulic fracturing has had on the energy sector, the physical mechanisms that control its efficiency and environmental impacts remain poorly understood in part because the length scales involved range from nanometres to kilometres. We characterize flow and transport in shale formations across and between these scales using integrated computational, theoretical and experimental efforts/methods. At the field scale, we use discrete fracture network modelling to simulate production of a hydraulically fractured well from a fracture network that is based on the site characterization of a shale gas reservoir. At the core scale, we use triaxial fracture experiments and a finite-discrete element model to study dynamic fracture/crack propagation in low permeability shale. We use lattice Boltzmann pore-scale simulations and microfluidic experiments in both synthetic and shale rock micromodels to study pore-scale flow and transport phenomena, including multi-phase flow and fluids mixing. A mechanistic description and integration of these multiple scales is required for accurate predictions of production and the eventual optimization of hydrocarbon extraction from unconventional reservoirs. Finally, we discuss the potential of CO2 as an alternative working fluid, both in fracturing and re-stimulating activities, beyond its environmental advantages.This article is part of the themed issue 'Energy and the subsurface'.},

To address topological properties of these two networks, we quantified correlations between connectivities of interacting nodes and compared them to a null model of a network, in which all links were randomly rewired. We found that for both interaction and regulatory networks, links between highly connected proteins are systematically suppressed, whereas those between a highly connected and low-connected pairs of proteins are favored. This effect decreases the likelihood of cross talk between different functional modules of the cell and increases the overall robustness of a network by localizing effects of deleterious perturbations.},

@article{Estrada2012,
abstract = {A fundamental problem in the study of complex networks is to provide quantitative measures of correlation and information flow between different parts of a system. To this end, several notions of communicability have been introduced and applied to a wide variety of real-world networks in recent years. Several such communicability functions are reviewed in this paper. It is emphasized that communication and correlation in networks can take place through many more routes than the shortest paths, a fact that may not have been sufficiently appreciated in previously proposed correlation measures. In contrast to these, the communicability measures reviewed in this paper are defined by taking into account all possible routes between two nodes, assigning smaller weights to longer ones. This point of view naturally leads to the definition of communicability in terms of matrix functions, such as the exponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument is either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the network.Considerable insight on communicability can be gained by modeling a network as a system of oscillators and deriving physical interpretations, both classical and quantum-mechanical, of various communicability functions. Applications of communicability measures to the analysis of complex systems are illustrated on a variety of biological, physical and social networks. The last part of the paper is devoted to a review of the notion of locality in complex networks and to computational aspects that by exploiting sparsity can greatly reduce the computational efforts for the calculation of communicability functions for large networks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

While the characteristics of small-world networks are nov: fairly well understood, there is as yet no work on what drives the emergence of such a network architecture. In situations such as neural or transportation networks. where a physical distance between the nodes of the network exists, we study whether the small-world topology arises as a consequence of a tradeoff between maximal connectivity and minimal wiring. Using simulated annealing, we study the properties of a randomly rewired network as the relative tradeoff between wiring and connectivity is varied. When the network seeks to minimize wiring, a regular graph results. At the other extreme, when connectivity is maximized, a "random" network is obtained. In the intermediate regime, a small-world network is formed. However, unlike the model of Watts and Strogatz [Nature 393, 440 (1998)], we find an alternate route to small-world behavior through the formation of hubs, small clusters where one vertex is connected to a large number of neighbors.},

abstract = {A full-scale 3D analysis of a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar experiment on granite material using a 3D combined Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM) is shown. Previous efforts to simulate Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar experiments using the 2D FDEM had obtained a very good match for the loading portion of the experiment. This work extends those efforts by modeling the entire 3D Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar experimental setup, and reproducing the softening behavior of the sample after breakage. This modeling effort introduces the effect of a compliant interface between the bars and the sample. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Estrada2005,
abstract = {We introduce a new centrality measure that characterizes the participation of each node in all subgraphs in a network. Smaller subgraphs are given more weight than larger ones, which makes this measure appropriate for characterizing network motifs. We show that the subgraph centrality (SC) can be obtained mathematically from the spectra of the adjacency matrix of the network. This measure is better able to discriminate the nodes of a network than alternate measures such as degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centralities. We study eight real-world networks for which SC displays useful and desirable properties, such as clear ranking of nodes and scale-free characteristics. Compared with the number of links per node, the ranking introduced by SC (for the nodes in the protein interaction network of S. cereviciae) is more highly correlated with the lethality of individual proteins removed from the proteome.},
