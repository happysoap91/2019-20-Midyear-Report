%%% Clinic reports use the clinic class, which should be located
%%% somewhere in TeX's search path.

%%% For your ``statement of work'' (or ``work statement''), specify
%%% the ``proposal'' document-class option to the hmcclinic class.
\documentclass[midyear]{cguclinic}

%%% There are also some changes in pagination styles and content
%%% that reflect the briefer nature of the proposal.  For example,
%%% in the longer reports, you use \frontmatter, \mainmatter, and
%%% \backmatter to separate some sections of the report from
%%% others.  In the statement of work, you don't need those
%%% commands, as no such division is necessary.

%%% Other packages needed by your document may be loaded here.

%%% The major difference between the statement of work and a midyear
%%% or final report is that the statement of work is typeset as an
%%% article, which means that the highest level of structural
%%% division available to you is section rather than chapter.

%%% There are also some changes in pagination styles and content
%%% that reflect the briefer nature of the proposal.  For example,
%%% in the longer reports, you use \frontmatter, \mainmatter, and
%%% \backmatter to separate some sections of the report from
%%% others.  In the statement of work, you don't need those
%%% commands, as no such division is necessary.

%% What is the name of the company or organization sponsoring your project?

%% What is the title of your report?
\title{Graph Theoretic Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Atomic Scale Fracture in Silica-Based Glasses}

%% Who are the authors of the report (your team members)?  (Separate

%%% End of information section.

%%% New commands and environments.

%%% You can define your own commands and environments here.  If you
%%% have a lot of material here, you might want to consider splitting
%%% the commands and environments into a separate ``style'' file that
%%% you load with \usepackage.

%\newcommand{\coolcommand}[1]{#1 is cool.} % Lets everyone know that
                                % the person or thing that you provide
                                % as the argument to the command is
                                % cool.


%%% Some theorem-like command definitions.

%%% The \newtheorem command comes from the amsthm package.  That
%%% package is loaded by the class file.

%%% Note that these definitions have changed from the version in the
%%% sample report document by dropping the ``within'' argument.  See
%%% Gratzer's _Math into LaTeX_ or the AMS-LaTeX documentation for
%%% more details.

% \newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Theo1}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Theo2}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Lemma}{Lemma}
\usepackage{url}


%%% If you find that some words in your document are being hyphenated
%%% incorrectly, you can specify the correct hyphenation using the
%%% \hyphenation command.  Note that words are separated by
%%% whitespace, as shown below.

%\hyphenation{ap-pen-dix wer-ther-i-an}
\tolerance=500

%%% The start of the document!

%% The document environment is the main environment in any LaTeX
%% document.  It contains other environments, as well as your text.

%%% Bibliography.

%%% Depending on your field, it may or may not be appropriate to list
%%% references for which you haven't included specific citations.  If
%%% your field sanctions such practices, or if you just want to get an
%%% idea of what you have in your bibliography file, you can include
%%% everything with the \nocite{*} command.          

%%% The appearance of your bibliography and citations in your text are
%%% defined by a combination of any bibliography-related LaTeX
%%% packages (such as natbib, harvard, or chicago) and the particular
%%% bibliography style file that you load with the \bibliographystyle
%%% command.  Bibliography-style files end in .bst; you can find them
%%% by searching your file system using whatever tools you have for
%%% doing searches.  (On most modern Unices, ``locate .bst'' will give
%%% you an idea of what's available.)
